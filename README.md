Trema is an OpenFlow controller programming framework that provides
everything needed to create OpenFlow controllers in Ruby. It provides
a high-level OpenFlow library and also a network emulator that can
create OpenFlow-based networks for testing on your PC. This
self-contained environment helps streamlines the entire process of
development and testing.
