# Contributing to Trema

* Check out the latest develop to make sure the feature hasn't been
  implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
  requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
  in a future version unintentionally.
* Squash your commits.
* Create a pull-request.
