What is tremashark?
===================

"tremashark" provides a wireshark (http://www.wireshark.org/) plugin and a
bridge between the Trema world and wireshark to display various events on
wireshark. You can monitor any IPC events among Trema modules, packets on
network interfaces/links, or log messages in realtime. It should be useful
for learning the Trema world and debugging your OpenFlow controller
applications.


How to build and install?
=========================

Pre-requirements
----------------

You need to download the source code of wireshark before you start to build
tremashark. We have tested with wireshark 1.6.10 and 1.8.2. Note that the
package "wireshark-dev" included in Ubuntu or Debian will not work for
building the wireshark plugin. You can get the source code from the following
site:

  http://www.wireshark.org/download.html

Also, you may need to install several software packages.

  $ sudo apt-get install wireshark flex bison libgtkmm-2.4-dev

Build and install
-----------------

Before building tremashark, you should compile Trema (see INSTALL) first.
Then build the plugin as follows:

  $ cd [trema]/src/tremashark/plugin
  $ tar xvf /somewhere/wireshark-X.Y.Z.tar.bz2
  $ ln -s wireshark-X.Y.Z wireshark
  $ cd wireshark
  $ ./configure
  $ cd ../packet-trema
  $ make
  $ mkdir -p ~/.wireshark/plugins
  $ cp packet-trema.so ~/.wireshark/plugins
  $ cp ../user_dlts ~/.wireshark/


How to run?
===========

1. Add `use_tremashark' directive in your Trema configuration. e.g.,

  use_tremashark

  vswitch {
    datapath_id "0x1"
  }
  ...

2. Send SIGUSR2 to processes to be monitored by tremashark. e.g.,

  $ sudo kill -USR2 `cat tmp/pid/learning_switch.pid`
  $ sudo kill -USR2 `cat tmp/pid/switch.0x1.pid`

Known issue
===========

- Wireshark plugin would not correctly reassemble messages when plural
  fragments are on a single packet.
