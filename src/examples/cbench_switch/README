This directory includes a dedicated OpenFlow controller implementation
for "cbench" OpenFlow controller benchmark suite.


# How to Run

Run this controller

  % ./trema run ./objects/examples/cbench_switch/cbench_switch

then, on another terminal

  % ./objects/oflops/bin/cbench --switches 1 --loops 10 --delay 1000


or, the following automatically executes a series of benchmarks:

  % ./build.rb cbench


Enjoy!
