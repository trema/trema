Feature: kill a trema process with `trema kill' command

  As a Trema user
  I want to kill a trema processes with `trema kill' command
  So that I can emulate failures on switch/host/link


  Scenario: kill a switch
    Given I try trema run "./src/examples/switch_monitor/switch-monitor.rb" with following configuration (backgrounded):
      """
      vswitch { datapath_id "0x1" }
      vswitch { datapath_id "0x2" }
      vswitch { datapath_id "0x3" }
      """
      And wait until "SwitchMonitor" is up
    When I try to run "./trema kill 0x1"
      And *** sleep 1 ***
    Then vswitch 0x1 is terminated


  Scenario: kill a host
    Given I try trema run "./src/examples/switch_monitor/switch-monitor.rb" with following configuration (backgrounded):
      """
      vswitch { datapath_id "0x1" }
      vhost "host"
      link "0x1", "host"
      """
      And wait until "SwitchMonitor" is up
    When I try to run "./trema kill host"
      And *** sleep 1 ***
    Then host is terminated


  Scenario: kill a controller
    Given I try trema run "./src/examples/switch_monitor/switch-monitor.rb" with following configuration (backgrounded):
      """
      vswitch { datapath_id "0x1" }
      """
      And wait until "SwitchMonitor" is up
    When I try to run "./trema kill SwitchMonitor"
      And *** sleep 1 ***
    Then SwitchMonitor is terminated
