Feature: "show_topology" example
  
  show_topology is a simple usage example of topology C API.
  show-topology.rb is a simple usage example of topology Ruby API.
  
  show_topology command will query for all the link information that 
  the topology manager hold and print them in trema network DSL style.
  
  Topology manager's link discovery feature must be enabled prior to running 
  show_topology command in order to obtain non-empty result.
  
  Topology manager's link discovery feature can be enabled 
  by specifing "--always_run_discovery" option when starting topology daemon,
  or by calling enable_topology_discovery() API from client application.

  Background: 
    Given I cd to "../../src/examples/topology/"
