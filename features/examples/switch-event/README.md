# Switch Event forwarding API

Switch Event forwarding API is a 
set of methods to add/remove an event forwarding entry to 
Switch Manager and Switch Daemons.

These API can be used when: 
* Adding another controller to mirror events for debugging purpose.
* Letting a controller, which was started afterwards, to listen on existing switch's events.
* Removing controller which was listening on events for debugging purpose.
* Replacing the controller which is handling switch event type.
* One needs to check which controller is handling certain event type.

The types of switch event can be forwarded are: 
* :vendor
* :packet_in
* :port_stat
* :state_notify.

Switch events are forwarded to Controllers based on the 
event forwarding entries on a Switch Daemon.  
Initial forwarding entries of a Switch Daemons is derived from the 
forwarding entries of the Switch Manager.  

In other words, configuring Switch Daemon will change the behavior of 
existing switches, and configuring Switch Manager will change the behavior 
of switches which may appear in the future.

Note that these APIs will only change where each event is forwarded, 
and it will **not** emulate any switch events, which normally occurs when a 
switch is connected to or disconnected from a controller.
* swich_ready event will **not** be generated by adding an entry to existing switch.
* disconnected event will **not** be generated by removing an entry from existing switch.

Please see the YARD generated document for each API details.
