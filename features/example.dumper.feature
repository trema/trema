Feature: Dump openflow events with dumper

  As a Trema user
  I want to dump OpenFlow events with dumper example application
  So that I can visualize OpenFlow messages


  Scenario: Dump packet_in events
    Given I try trema run "./objects/examples/dumper/dumper" with following configuration (backgrounded):
      """
      vswitch("dumper") { datapath_id "0xabc" }

      vhost("host1") {
        ip "192.168.0.1"
        mac "00:00:00:00:00:01"
      }
      vhost("host2") {
        ip "192.168.0.2"
        mac "00:00:00:00:00:02"
      }

      link "dumper", "host1"
      link "dumper", "host2"
      """
      And wait until "dumper" is up
    When I try to run "./trema send_packets --source host1 --dest host2 --length=0"
      And I terminated all trema services
    Then the output should include:
      """
      [packet_in]
        datapath_id: 0xabc
